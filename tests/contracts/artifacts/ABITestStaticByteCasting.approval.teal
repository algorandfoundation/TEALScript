// This TEAL was generated by TEALScript
// https://github.com/algorand-devrel/TEALScript

// The following ten lines of TEAL handle initial program flow
// This pattern is used to make it easy for anyone to parse the start of the program and determine if a specific action is allowed
// Here, action refers to the OnComplete in combination with whether the app is being created or called
// Every possible action for this contract is represented in the switch statement
// If the action is not implmented in the contract, its repsective branch will be "NOT_IMPLMENTED" which just contains "err"
