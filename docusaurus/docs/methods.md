## Typing
All method arguments MUST have a type and all methods MUST have an explicit return type. 

### Examples

#### Valid
```ts
add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b
}
```

#### Invalid

```ts
add(a: number, b: number) { // missing return type
  return a + b
}
```

```ts
add(a, b: number): number { // missing argument type
  return a + b
}
```

## ABI Methods
All methods defined in your contract will be routed as ABI methods, unless they have the `private` keyword. This means they will be exposed in the ABI and Application Spec generated by TEALScript.

## Private Subroutines
A method defined with the `private` keyword will only be accessible within the contract itself via a subroutine. This means other contracts or end-users cannot call this method directly and it will not be exposed in the ABI or Application Spec.

### Example
In this example, there is a single public ABI method `doMath` which will then call the `add` or `subtract` subroutines depending on the method given. `doMath` is the only method that is externally callable.

```ts
class Calculator extends Contract {
  private getSum(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
  }

  private getDifference(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a >= b ? a - b : b - a;
  }

  /**
  * A method that takes two numbers and does either addition or subtraction
  *
  * @param a - The first number
  * @param b - The second number
  * @param operation - The operation to perform. Can be either 'sum' or 'difference'
  *
  * @returns The result of the operation
  */
  doMath(a: number, b: number, operation: string): number {
    let result: number;

    if (operation === 'sum') {
      result = this.getSum(a, b);
    } else if (operation === 'difference') {
      result = this.getDifference(a, b);
    } else throw Error('Invalid operation');

    return result;
  }
}
```
